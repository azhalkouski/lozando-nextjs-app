The prefers-color-scheme CC media feature is used to detect if a user has requested
light or dark color themes. A user indicates their preference through an operating

Using prefer-color-scheme is allowed in cross-origin <svg> and <iframe> elements.
Cross-origin elements are elements retrieved from a different host than the page

The color-scheme CSS property allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can
comfortably be rendered in. User agents change the following aspects of the UI chrome
to match the used color scheme:

- The color of the canvas surface.
- The default colors of scrollbars and other interaction UI.
- The default colors of form controls.
- The default colors of other browser-provided UI, such as "spellcheck" underlines.
